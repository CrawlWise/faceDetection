# faceDetection
The code snippet you described performs the following functions:
1. It uses the RetinaFace.detect_faces function to identify faces in pictures and camera. This function takes an image as input and returns the bounding boxes and landmarks of all the detected faces in the image.
2. It uses the RetinaFace.extract_faces function to extract each person's face from either the camera or picture. This function takes an image and the bounding box coordinates of a face as input and returns the cropped face image.
3. It saves each extracted face image in a SQLite database. The database is created and connected using the sqlite3 library in Python. The face images are saved as binary blobs in a table in the database, along with the person's name or ID as a text field.

Overall, the code snippet performs face detection, face extraction, and face-saving in a SQLite database. This could be useful for applications that require face recognition or tracking of individuals, such as security systems or attendance tracking systems.
